\section*{Answer 1}

\paragraph{(a)}

Given $\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_m \in \mathbb{C}$ and $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_m$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i = 1$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \mathbf{x}_i \geq 0$ for all $i=1, \ldots, m$, we want to show that $\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \mathbf{x}_i \in \mathbb{C}$.

Now, since $\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_m$ are in $\mathbb{C}$, by the definition of a convex set, for any $t \in [0,1]$, we have $ t \mathbf{x}_k + (1-t)\mathbf{x}_l \in \mathbb{C}$.

Consider the convex combination:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    &\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \left(t\mathbf{x}_k + (1-t)\mathbf{x}_l\right) 
    = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i t \mathbf{x}_k + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i (1-t) \mathbf{x}_l \\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    &= t \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \mathbf{x}_k + (1-t) \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \mathbf{x}_j \\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Now, due to the linearity of the sum, we can factor out $t$ and $(1-t)$:

\[
= t \mathbf{x}_i \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i  + (1-t) \mathbf{x}_j \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i
\]

Since $\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i = 1$, we get:

\[
= t \mathbf{x}_i + (1-t) \mathbf{x}_j
\]

This expression is a convex combination of points $\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_m$, and by the convexity of $\mathbb{C}$, it is also in $\mathbb{C}$.


\paragraph{(b)}
counterexample to illustrate that the composition of convex functions is not always convex: \\

Let \( f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) be defined as \( f(x) = x^2 \), which is a convex function. \\

Let \( g: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) be defined as \( g(x) = x^2-1 \), which is also convex. \\

Then we have \( h = f \circ g \), where \( h(x) = f(g(x)) \) be defined as \( h(x) = x^4-2x^2+1 \). \\

Let's choose two points $\mathbf{x}_1 = -1$ and $\mathbf{x}_2 = 1$, and $\mathbf{t} = 0.3$ in the range $[0, 1]$. \\
\[
    h(0.3(-1) + (0.7)1) = h(0.4) = 0.7056
\]
\[
    0.3h(-1) + (0.7)h(1) = 0
\]
\[
    0.7056 > 0
\]


Therefore \( h(x) = x^4-2x^2+1 \) is not convex, so we cannot say \( f \circ g \) is convex if \( g \) and \( f \) are convex functions.
\paragraph{(c)}

\textbf{Implication 1:}

Assume \( f(·) \) is a convex function. We should show that \( S \) is a convex set, and \( g(t) = f(x + tv) \) is convex for all \( t \) such that \( x + tv \in S \).

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Convexity of \( S \):} Since \( f(·) \) is defined on \( S \), and \( f(·) \) is convex, it implies that \( S \) must be a convex set. This is because the domain of a convex function is always convex.
    
    \item \textbf{Convexity of \( g(t) = f(x + tv) \):} Let \( y_1 = x + t_1v \) and \( y_2 = x + t_2v \) be two points in \( S \) where \( t_1, t_2 \) are such that \( x + t_1v, x + t_2v \in S \). \\
    Now, consider \( z = \lambda y_1 + (1 - \lambda) y_2 \), where \( \lambda \) is a convex combination coefficient (\( 0 \leq \lambda \leq 1 \)). \( z = \lambda (x + t_1v) + (1 - \lambda)(x + t_2v) \) and \( z = x + (\lambda t_1 + (1 - \lambda)t_2)v \). \\
    Since \( S \) is convex, \( x + (\lambda t_1 + (1 - \lambda)t_2)v \in S \), and by the convexity of \( f(·) \), \( g(t) = f(x + tv) \) is convex.
\end{enumerate}

Therefore, the first implication holds. \\

\textbf{Implication 2:}

Assume \( S \) is a convex set, and \( g(t) = f(x + tv) \) is convex for all \( t \) such that \( x + tv \in S \). We want to show that \( f(·) \) is a convex function.

To show that \( f(·) \) is convex, we need to consider two arbitrary points \( x_1, x_2 \) in the domain of \( f(·) \) and show that \( f(\lambda x_1 + (1 - \lambda) x_2) \leq \lambda f(x_1) + (1 - \lambda) f(x_2) \) for all \( \lambda \) in \([0, 1]\).

Consider \( x_1, x_2 \) in the domain of \( f(·) \). Let \( \lambda \) be a convex combination coefficient (\( 0 \leq \lambda \leq 1 \)). Now, consider \( z = \lambda x_1 + (1 - \lambda) x_2 \). Since \( S \) is convex, \( z \) is also in \( S \). Therefore, we can use the convexity of \( g(t) = f(x + tv) \) for \( t \) such that \( x + tv = z \).
\[ g(t) = f(x + tv) = f(\lambda x_1 + (1 - \lambda) x_2) \]
By the convexity of \( g(t) \):
\[ f(\lambda x_1 + (1 - \lambda) x_2) \leq \lambda f(x_1) + (1 - \lambda) f(x_2) \]

Therefore, the second implication holds.

Since both implications hold, we can conclude that a function \( f(·) \) is convex if and only if \( S \) is a convex set, and the function \( g(t) = f(x + tv) \) is convex for all \( t \) such that \( x + tv \in S \).

\subparagraph{(iii) if X is finite}

\par \hspace*{1em}$X$ is in $\Sigma$:

\par \hspace*{1em}Since $X - X = \emptyset$ (the empty set) is finite, $X$ is in $\Sigma$.

\par \hspace*{1em}$\Sigma$ is closed under complementation:

\par \hspace*{1em}If $U$ is in $\Sigma$, then $X - U$ is finite or all of $X$. The complement of $U$ is $X - U$. If $X - U$ is finite, then $U$ is in $\Sigma$. If $X - U$ is all of $X$, then $U$ is also in $\Sigma$. Therefore, $\Sigma$ is closed under complementation.

\par \hspace*{1em}$\Sigma$ is closed under finite unions:

\par \hspace*{1em}Let $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ be sets in $\Sigma$. This means that for each $A_i$, $X - A_i$ is either finite or all of $X$.

\par \hspace*{1em}Consider the union $A = A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \ldots$. The complement of $A$ is
\[
X - A = (X - A_1) \cap (X - A_2) \cap \ldots.
\]

\par \hspace*{1em}If for each $i$, $X - A_i$ is finite, then $X - A$ is also finite (finite union of finite sets is finite). If for each $i$, $X - A_i$ is all of $X$, then $X - A$ is also all of $X$.

\par \hspace*{1em}Therefore, $\Sigma$ is closed under finite unions.

\par \hspace*{1em}Since the set $\Sigma$ satisfies all three properties, it is a $\sigma$-algebra on the finite set $X$.

\subparagraph{(iii) if X is finite}
\par \hspace*{1em}
\par \hspace*{1em}\textbf{1. $X$ is in $\Sigma$:}

In this case, $X$ itself is in the set because $X-X=$ \(\emptyset\) is in the set. So, the first property is satisfied.

\par \hspace*{1em}\textbf{2. $\Sigma$ is closed under complementation:}

If $A$ is in $\Sigma$, then $X - A$ is infinite or $\emptyset$ or $X$. Let's consider each case:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $A$ is finite where $A\neq X$ and  $A\neq \emptyset$ , then $X - A$ is also finite, which is not in the set.
    \item If $A$ is $\emptyset$, then $X - A$ is $X$, which is in the set.
    \item If $A$ is $X$, then $X - A$ is $\emptyset$, which is in the set.
\end{itemize}
So, the set is closed under complementation.

\par \hspace*{1em}\textbf{3. $\Sigma$ is closed under countable unions:}

Let $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ be sets in $\Sigma$. We want to show that their union,
\[
A = A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \ldots,
\]
is also in $\Sigma$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Since we have only two elements in this set, which is $\emptyset$ and $X$, then $A = X \cup \emptyset = X$ is also in the set.    
\end{itemize}
Since all three properties are satisfied, the given set is a $\sigma$-algebra on the finite set $X$.


\section*{Answer 3}

\paragraph{(a)}
\textbf{Suppose $ax \equiv b \pmod{p}$ has a solution.}

This implies that there exists an integer $x$ such that $ax - b = p \cdot q$ for some integer $q$.

Take $d = \gcd(a, p)$. We have:

\[
a = a \cdot t + p \cdot r
\]

where $t$ and $r$ are integers.

Since $d = \gcd(a, p)$, it follows that $d$ divides both $a$ and $p$. Therefore, we can express $a$ and $n$ as:

\[
a = d \cdot q_1 \quad \text{where} \quad q_1 \in \mathbb{Z}
\]

\[
p = d \cdot q_2 \quad \text{where} \quad q_2 \in \mathbb{Z}
\]

Lastly, from the earlier expression $ax - b = p \cdot q$, we can substitute $a$ and $n$ using the above expressions:

\[
b = a \cdot x - p \cdot q = (d \cdot q_1) \cdot x - (d \cdot q_2) \cdot q = d \cdot (q_1 \cdot x - q_2 \cdot q)
\]

Let $c = q_1 \cdot x - q_2 \cdot q$, then $b = d \cdot c$.

Thus, $d = \gcd(a, p)$ divides $b$, indicating that if there is a solution to $ax \equiv b \pmod{n}$, then $d = \gcd(a, p)$ divides $b$. \\

\textbf{Suppose $d = \gcd(a, p)$ and $d \mid b$.}

Then we have
\[
\begin{cases}
    d = a \cdot t + p \cdot r, & \text{$t, r \in \mathbb{Z}$} \\
    d \mid b
\end{cases}
\]

From these equations, it follows that
\[
b = d \cdot c = (a \cdot t + p \cdot r) \cdot c = atc + prc \implies b - a \cdot (tc) = p \cdot (rc) \implies a \cdot (tc) = b \pmod{p}
\]

This implies that $ax \equiv b \pmod{p}$ has a solution, where $x = t \cdot c$. \\

Therefore,the congruence $ax \equiv b \pmod{p}$ has a solution for $x$ if and only if $\gcd(a, p) \mid b$.
\paragraph{(b)}
\paragraph{(c)}
The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) asks for a (common) solution \(x\) to a system of congruences

\[ x \equiv \begin{cases} a_1 \pmod{p_1} \\ a_2 \pmod{p_2} \\ a_3 \pmod{p_3} \\ \vdots \\ a_k \pmod{p_k} \end{cases} \]

with \(\gcd(p_i, p_j) = 1\) for \(i \neq j\). The theorem states that there are infinitely many solutions, and any two differ by a multiple of \(\operatorname{lcm}(p_1, p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_k)\).


\section*{Answer 4}
\paragraph{(a)}
Let's denote this set by \(X^{\omega}\). Then we will show that a function \(g : \mathbb{Z}^+ \rightarrow X^{\omega}\) cannot be surjective
to prove the uncountability of this set.
\\ \\
Let's denote this set by \(X^\omega\). We will show that a function \(g:\mathbb{Z}^+ \rightarrow X^\omega\) cannot be surjective to prove the uncountability of this set.

For a function \(g\) defined as \(g(n) = (x_{n1}, x_{n2}, \ldots, x_{nn}, \ldots)\) where each \(x_{ij}\) belongs to the set \(X = \{a, b, \ldots, z\}\), consider the element \(y = (y_1, y_2, \ldots) \in X^\omega\) given by:

\[
y_n = 
\begin{cases}
    x_{nn} & \text{if } x_{nn} \neq a \\
    b & \text{if } x_{nn} = a
\end{cases}
\]
\\ \\
In other words, \(y\) is constructed such that it differs from each \(g(n)\) by at least one coordinate. This means that \(y\) is not mapped to by \(g\), and therefore, \(g\) cannot be surjective.
\\ \\
This argument generalizes to any countable product of a set \(X\) with \(\lvert X \rvert > 1\). If \(X\) has \(\lvert X \rvert = k\) elements, then there are \(k^{\mathbb{N}}\) distinct sequences in the countable product \(X^\omega\), making it uncountable.



\paragraph{(b)}
Let \(Y = \bigcup_{i \in \mathbb{N}} Y_i\).

The sets \(Y_i\) are countable; therefore, there exist surjective functions \(f_i: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow Y_i\).

By Cantor's first diagonal argument, it is known that \(\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}\) is countable.

So let's define:

\[ F: \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \rightarrow Y \]

\[ (i, x) \mapsto f_i(x) \]

Per the definition of the union, this mapping is surjective.

So, \(Y\) is indeed countable.
